## Config

Look here for a good example how to get these:

The `secret` private key needs to have \n instead of newlines in the correct places.
The `redirectUri` needs to be https. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)/[serveo](https://serveo.net) works for development but you need to have the uri added in you apple dev account in the return urls.

```
"apple": {
  "teamId": "",
  "clientId": "",
  "keyId": "",
  "secret": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nABC\nABC\nABC\nABC\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "redirectUri": "https://abc.def/_oauth/apple"
},
```

## Oauth post body fix

I had to fix the oauth package to make it work with post body data.
You need to add the package from my fork:
